# The format of a schedule file is JSON and is a simple dictionary where
# the keys are instance ids and the values are the schedule.  For example:
#
# {
#   "i-0e9a319eb328f50a5": "00:00-08:00",
#   "i-026bc072204e7ab9a": "16:00-02:00"
# }
#
# That would say to run the instance that ends in "9" from midnight to 8
# each day (GMT) and to run the instance that ends in "6" from 8 pm to 2
# am each day (so it spans midnight GMT).
